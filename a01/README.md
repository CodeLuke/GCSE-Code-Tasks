# Assesment 1

This problem set is designed to test your understanding of
basic conditionals, and iteration with integers.  There are
six problems, and they are designed to be have a range of
difficulties. In each topic, there is a more simple problem
followed by a more difficult one.

There are 30 marks available in total and the number of marks available
for each question is in brackets alongside each question. Each
failed test will result in the loss of one mark. Code that is
written to pass the tests, rather than solve the problem,
will not be awarded any marks.

Good luck
