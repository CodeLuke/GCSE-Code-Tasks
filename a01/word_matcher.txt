Problem:

    
The function 'matcher' should take two strings as inputs.
    
If they are:
      
      
* Exactly the same, it should print "Exact match"
      
* The same word but different case, it should print "Partial match"
    
    
Otherwise, print "No match"


Tests:

    
>>> matcher("Boom", "Boom")
    
Exact match
    
>>> matcher("Shake", "shake")
    
Partial match
    
>>> matcher("The", "room")
    
No match
    
>>> matcher("tick", "Tick")
    
Partial match
    
>>> matcher("boom", ".")
    
No match
