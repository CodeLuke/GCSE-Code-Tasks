# GCSE Code Tasks
This is a repository of 60 problems and 2 open-ended exercises that were given to a group of 15 year olds as an introduction to computer science.
These problems are intended for those who want to learn the basics of programming.
They are also very useful when learning new programming languages to strengthen theoretical learning with practical applications.

They provide a steady learning curve which offers a challenge to new programmers and offers more experienced programmers the opportunity to implement more intricate solutions.

## Personal Context
These problems were given to me as my first introduction to programming when I was 15.
The slope of difficulty was easy enough to not be daunting but challenging enough to not be boring.

I have seen first-hand how well these problems work with those that have no programming experience, and I continue to use them to provide practice when I learn new programming languages

## How to Use
These problems were originally organised as separate git repositories that students would fork, pull down and complete before creating a pull request.
In order to maintain a sense of organisation within my personal git profile, these repositories have been moved into separate folders within this single repository.
I still *highly* recommend that those new to programming still create their own fork of this problem set and get used to committing and pushing to git repositories.
Git is one of the best tools someone can learn, it has saved my skin on many an occasion and the guides to git within the READMEs are as intuitive as the tasks themselves.

Each folder in this repository contains a text file containing the problems and examples, the README which was in the original repository and any solutions to the problem that I have created.
The problems were originally set using python, so the READMEs provide helpful hints in this language. 
All problem sets contain solutions in python. In due time I will also add solutions in other languages.

These tasks are designed to get a grasp of coding.
They are not designed for production code and as such the solutions will include unhandled exceptions and will not cover all cases.
