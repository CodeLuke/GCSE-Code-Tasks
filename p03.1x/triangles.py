"""
Problem:

    
The triangle numbers are: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, ...
    
They are generated by starting at 0 and going up by 1,
    
then adding one more to the difference each time.

    
The function triangle_numbers takes an integer n,
    
and should then print the nth triangle number.

Tests:

    
>>> triangle_number(1)
1
    
>>> triangle_number(3)
6
    
>>> triangle_number(7)
28
    
>>> triangle_number(50)
1275
