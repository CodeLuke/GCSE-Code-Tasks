Problem:

    
The function 'balance' divides a piece of text into two equal halves.
    
For example:  'turtle' -> 'tur' and 'tle'

    
If words have an odd number of characters, it ignores the middle one:
    
For example:  'turtles' -> 'tur' and 'les'

    
Each letter is given a scor
e, A=1, B=2 and so on, and a total score
    
found for each half.

    
If the first half has a greater score, it should print "Start"
    
If the second half has a greater score, it should print "End"
    
If they are the same, it should print "Balanced"


Tests:

    
>>> balance("turtle")
    
Start
    
>>> balance("elephant")
    
End
    
>>> balance("gorilla")
    
Start
    
>>> balance("horse")
    
End
    
>>> balance("kayak")
    
Balanced
