Problem:

    
Julius Caesar is credited with inventing one of the first ways
    
of encrypting messages for transmission. A Caesar cipher works
    
by replacing each of the characters in a piece of text with the
    
character a certain number of spaces along in the alphabet.

    
For example, if we moved 'APE' 3 along it would become 'DSH'.
    
    
Moving past 'Z' should take us back to 'A'.

    
The function 'encode' takes a piece of text and should move
    
it along the alphabet n spaces.

    
The function 'decode' should do the opposite.

    
All text will be given in uppercase. No punctuation will be
    
included, other than spaces - these should not be encoded.

Tests:

    
>>> encode("APE", 3)
    
DSH
    
>>> encode("HELLO WORLD", 12)
    
TQXXA IADXP
    
>>> encode("JULIUS CAESAR", 9)
    
SDURDB LJNBJA
    
>>> decode("DSH", 3)
    
APE
    
>>> decode("SDURB LJNBJA", 9)
    
JULIS CAESAR
    
>>> decode("TQXXA IADXP", 12)
    
HELLO WORLD
