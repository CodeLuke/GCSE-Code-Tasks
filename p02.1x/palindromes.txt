Problem:

    
A palindrome is a number or word that reads the same forwards as backwards,
    
such as "mum", "racecar" or 12321.

    
The function palindromic takes a 3-digit number and should print "Yes"
    
if a number is palindromic, and "No" if it isn't.

Tests:

    
>>> palindromic(121)
    
Yes
    
>>> palindromic(575)
    
Yes
    
>>> palindromic(999)
    
Yes
    
>>> palindromic(234)
    
No
    
>>> palindromic(741)
    
No
